### Scenario A: Sales Computer

#### OS

[Qumolo](https://qumulo.com/) is about to aggressively expand its sales division and wants to standardize its virtual desktops to Windows 10 Pro. Sales reps will be utilizing [Microsoft Outlook Desktop Mail Client](https://outlook.live.com/calendar/). The demo prototypes should use trial editions of this software. The sales reps will be collaborating over [Microsoft OneDrive](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/onedrive/online-cloud-storage) and will need the agent downloaded and synchronized to their account. Their 365 email accounts should be synchronized to their Outlook clients.

Software engineers at Qumolo will be using Ubuntu Linux Desktop (use the latest version available). They'll need VS Code installed to get them started. They'll be using Mozilla Thunderbird to connect to their Microsoft 365 email accounts.

#### Data

Each desktop should come standard with a backup hard drive that clones every night at midnight the user profile data of the computer's sales rep. The entire OS must be backed up to the backup drive as well, once per week.

#### Connectivity

The sales rep will remote into this computer from home. The sales rep is only proficient with a GUI desktop interface and is otherwise not a technical computer user.
